   - Display a visual representation of the wheel with equal segments for each option.

2. **Options Input:**
   - Provide a user interface where users can input options for the spin wheel.
   - Users should be able to add a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 10 options.

3. **Spin Button:**
   - Include a button labeled "Spin" that users can click to initiate the spin animation.

4. **Spinner Animation:**
   - Implement an animation that rotates the wheel when the "Spin" button is clicked.
   - The spinner should stop at a random option after a certain duration.

5. **Result Display:**
   - Display the selected option after the spinner stops spinning.
   - Provide a clear visual indication of the result.

6. **User Experience:**
   - Design the user interface for a seamless and user-friendly experience.
   - Ensure that users can easily add options, initiate the spin, and see the result.

7. **Code Quality:**
   - Write clean, well-structured, and documented code following Flutter best practices.
   - Use appropriate variable names and maintain consistent coding conventions.

8. **Submission:**
   - Host the codebase on a version control system (e.g., GitHub) with clear commit history.
   - Provide a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run the app locally.
